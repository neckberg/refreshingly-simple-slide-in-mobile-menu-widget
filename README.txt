Add a simple slide-in mobile hamburger menu / widget area to your site.

== Description ==

**Perfectly Simple Mobile Menu Widget** will add a slide-in menu / widget to your WordPress site.

Most mobile menu plugins suffer from a few problems:
1. They are overstyled, and don't match the rest of your theme
2. The lock you into a standard layout, for instance, just a single menu and an optional logo
3. They are overly complex to configure and customize

This plugin solves these problems as follows:
1. Minimal styling: inherits styles from your theme.
2. The contents of the menu is actually just a standard widget area. Add menus, images, shortcodes, or anything you want, in any order.
3. Almost no settings. Just add widgets to the plugin's widget area and you are good to go!
