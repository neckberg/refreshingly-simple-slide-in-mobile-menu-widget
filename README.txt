Add a simple slide-in mobile hamburger menu / widget area to your site.

== Description ==

**Refreshingly Simple Slide-in Mobile Menu Widget** will add a slide-in menu / widget to your WordPress site.

Simply install, add widgets to the 'RSSMMW Mobile Drawer' widget area, and "voila!" - You will have a perfectly functioning slide-in menu!

Most mobile menu plugins suffer from a few problems:
1. They are over styled, and don't match the rest of your theme.
2. They lock you into a standard layout - for instance, just a single menu and an optional logo.
3. They are overly complex to configure and customize.

This plugin solves those problems with:
1. Minimal styling: inherits styles from your theme.
2. A standard widget area. The contents of the mobile menu drawer is actually just a widget area. Add menus, images, shortcodes, or anything you want, in any order.
3. No settings - just add widgets to the plugin's widget area and you are good to go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can I change the background color?**
Yes. In your WordPress Admin Dashboard, go to Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS
add the following snippet - just replace 'white' with whatever color you need:
.rssmmw-mobile-drawer {
  background-color: white;
}
